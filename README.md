The goal of the website is to allow potential customers (users) to view the artist's portfolio of completed tattoos and available designs, and also to get a sense of the atmosphere and vibe of the studio and the artist.

When researching tattoo artists and studios, the artist's body of work is often just one of a number of factors that potential customers consider. A potential customer may ask such questions as: 
- Does the artist seem friendly and approachable? 
- Will they make me feel comfortable and relaxed, not only when getting the tattoo but also when choosing and discussing the design? 
- How appealing does the studio appear? Does it look clean and inviting? Does it seem relaxing or loud and busy? Will I be visible to people who may be coming and going from the studio?
- Is this a space where I will feel safe and respected? 

The tattoo itself is often not the sole deciding factor when choosing where to get a tattoo - the accompanying experience can be just as important for many potentials customers.
