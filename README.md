# Guilguri Tattoo Studio
![Guilguri mock-up screenshot](https://github.com/wayne-AF/p1-guilguri-tattoo-studio/blob/main/documentation/guilguri-mock-up%20screenshot-2.png?raw=true)
## Background
This website has been created for Guilguri Tattoo Studio, a small tattooing business that has a social media presence, primarily on Instagram, but which did not have a dedicated website. The owner and operator of Guilguri Tattoo Studio is my husband, Guilherme Fidelis, who, for the purposes of this project, acted as the client. 

Guilherme had a number of specific ideas and requirements for the website, some of which have been included in the final submitted build, while others have not yet been implemented due in part to my own current limitations as regards the skills and technologies available to me within the context and scope of the project. In line with the advice to treat this website as a real-world project as opposed to a project created solely to be assessed and graded, I have tried to work with and incorporate as many of Guilherme's requests while also fulfilling the project requirements.

## User Experience
### User Stories
When researching and choosing a tattoo artist and accompanying studio for a tattoo, the artist's body of work in just one of a number of factors that potential customers consider. A potential customer may ask such questions as:

- What impression do I get from the artist? 
- Does the artist seem friendly and approachable? 
- Will the artist make me feel comfortable and relaxed, not only when getting the tattoo but also when choosing and discussing the design? 
- What impression do I get from the studio where I'll be getting the tattoo?
- Does the studio look clean and inviting and comfortable?
- Does the studio seem relaxing or loud and busy?
- Will it be private or will I be visible to people coming and going from the studio or even visible to passers-by?
- Is the studio a space where I will feel safe and respected?

The tattoo itself is often not the sole deciding factor when choosing where to get a tattoo. The accompanying experience can be just as important for many potential customers, particularly those who may be looking to receive their first tattoo and may feel nervous and unsure and want to find an artist and studio to make them feel at ease. 

#### User goals:
- To view Guilherme's portfolio of completed tattoos
- To view Guilherme's portfolio of available tattoos
- To locate a method of contacting Guilherme to discuss a tattoo
- To see photos of the studio in order to get a sense of the atmosphere and vibe
- To see Guilherme and to learn a little bit about him
- To access enough information to form an impression of Guilherme, his work, and his tattoo studio

#### Client goals:
- To reach new potential customers, particularly those who do not have an Instagram account
- To guide new potential customers to his Instagram account (if they already use the platform)
- To have a space where he may potentially showcase and sell his artwork
- To have a more customisable and personal platform for his business

With this in mind, Guilherme wanted a website that would fulfil the following main criteria: 
- A simple and clean site layout and colour scheme
- Show his portfolio of completed and available tattoos
- Display his own photo and a small biography
- Display some photos of the studio
- A page to contact Guilherme to enquire about available tattoos or discuss an original design
- A link to the Guilguri Tattoo Studio Instagram page
- A drag-and-drop box in the contact form where potential customers could include reference photos when contacting Guilherme

Of these criteria, only the last one has not been fulfilled due to the necessity of incorporating JavaScript, which is not yet within my skillset and is also outside the immediate scope of this project. However, this is a feature which is intended to be implemented at a later date, alongside others which are detailed below in the Features section.  

### Design
Guilherme's primary request for the website was that it have a simple and clean aesthetic. He wanted a muted, neutral colour scheme that would complement the single-tone black of his tattoo designs. 

#### Colours
For the text colour, I chose a simple black. This mimics the plain black ink used by Guilherme in his tattoos and it is easy for users to read. 

After some experimentation, I chose linen as the background colour across the entire website. It's a neutral but warm colour that contrasts well with the black text and the greyish background colour that Guilherme uses for his available tattoo designs. It also contrasts nicely with the photos of the studio and completed tattoos as it makes them appear more vibrant and colourful and prevents the site as a whole from seeming too austere.

#### Fonts
For the main body text, I used Raleway from Google Fonts, a clean and readable font which also has a sense of roundness to it. I spaced the letters further apart to enhance readability. 

For the logo and the welcome h2 on the homepage, I used Yuji Syuku from Google Fonts, which has both handwritten and typewriter qualities to it, simultaneously suggesting structure and art.

The use of lower case in the logo and all h2 headings is intentional, in order to give a casual feeling while still providing emphasis. 

The use of upper case in the navigation menu sets them apart in their own stylised group and contrasts with the use of lower case in the logo and h2 headings.

#### Imagery
All photos and images on the website are the property of Guilherme and were provided by him. 

I used original artwork from Guilherme as the main image on the homepage and for the background images across the other three pages. He had a number of pieces in the same sort of style, so each page has a different but similar image to provide continuity. I was able to upload the homepage image with only minor editing but the artwork on the other pages were all the same black colour, which would impede text readability. To fix this issue, I used an online image editing website to lower their opacity until it reached a level where the image remained visible without affecting the readability of the text on the site.

The background images are purposely positioned left, centre, and right on the About, Portfolio, and Contact pages respectively for some visual diversity.

#### Round corners
Much of Guilherme's artwork and tattoo designs have a focus on circles and round shapes. To echo this in the website's aesthetic, I opted to remove any sharp corners and instead used round corners on all images, text boxes, and hover effects across the site. This softens the site's aesthetic and adds cohesion and a sense of playfulness. 

#### Favicon
Guilherme has not yet created a logo for the studio. I created a placeholder favicon using a photo of the circular lamp from the studio wall.

## Features
The current iteration of the website is spread across four pages, with a header and footer on each. As detailed below in the Future features section, this number is intended to increase as new features are added to the site.  

### Header
The header consists of the website name on the left and navigation links on the right. An underline active-effect shows the user which page they are currently on. A black hover-effect shows which link the user is about to click on. On smaller screens, the navigation links are in a drop-down hamburger menu, where the links have a black background which floats over the page content. In order to give the rounded-corner effect to maintain visual continuity while giving the links the appearance of being inside a single block, I applied the round-corner effect to only the top corners of the first link (HOME) and the bottom corners of the last link (CONTACT).

### Footer
The footer section has three links. The studio does not yet have a Facebook page so the Facebook link opens in a new window to the Facebook sign-in page. The Instagram link opens in a new window to the studio's Instagram page. The third link opens in the same window and sends the user to the Contact page. I did not think it necessary to have this link open in a new window because the user is staying on the Guilguri site and can use the navigation bar if they wish to return to where they were. The icons also have a hover-effect similar to the navigation links in the header. 

### Home page
This is the landing page and the first things users will see when visiting the site. I wanted to use a dedicated welcome page with the actual word "welcome" because part of the website's point is to convey a sense of welcoming and hospitality to invite in the user. The "welcome" h2 is a link which takes the user to the About page. I applied a fade-in animation to the image and the h2 to give the user the impression of receiving a gentle welcome. 

### About page
This page has two sections: one section about Guilherme, and one about the studio. Guilherme provided several photos of himself but I chose this one because he appears friendly and good-natured and approachable, the sort of tattoo artist a potential customer would feel comfortable contacting and speaking with. I've included a short bio about Guilherme and his background. 

The second section is about the studio itself. The photos are intended to show that the studio is attractive, welcoming, comfortable, and private. The accompanying text attests to this and provides the general location of the studio. I initially wanted to create the studio photos as a carousel but this requires JavaScript and therefore was not within the scope of this project.

My initial thought was to include an address and map to the studio as is common on many other websites. However, because the studio is in a private residence, I decided it was better to just provide the general location. Besides this, the studio is private and does not allow for any walk-in customers; anyone attending the studio would be by appointment only and would have already been in contact with Guilherme and received directions to the studio. Guilherme agreed with this reasoning and did not want his home address freely available online. 

### Portfolio page
This page also has two sections: one section containing photos of Guilherme's completed tattoos, and the other section with available designs and accompanying titles. Both sections have responsive grid layouts that are clearly viewable on all screen sizes. I considered adding a feature for the images to be expanded to full-screen but because the images are clear and of sufficient quality, I decided this was not necessary for now but have added it to the list of potential future features. 

Guilherme does not ordinarily give titles or names to his tattoos. However, I thought naming the available designs would add some extra personality and irreverence to the website and also make it easier for customers to specify which design they're interested in. I named the designs myself, with Guilherme's approval. 

Also in this section is a call to action button. This brings the user to the Contact page, which opens in a new tab so they don't have to navigate back in case they forget the name of the tattoo they want to enquire about. 

### Contact page 
This page provides the user a means of contacting Guilherme about an available tattoo (the button on the Portfolio page opens this page in a new tab) or to discuss a custom tattoo idea. Originally, I included placeholder text within the text fields and left out form labels in order to achieve a cleaner look but I later added labels instead for the purposes of accessibility. 

All the text fields are required and any entered text will be in the same font (Raleway) as the rest of the site to provide visual cohesion. 


### Future features

- Expandable images in the portfolio section
- The studio section will have a carousel of photos instead of a grid
- A testimonial section with testimonials from past customers, also on a carousel
- An FAQ page that will answer many commonly-asked questions including those about pricing, etc. 
- A drag-and-drop box in the contact form that will allow potential customers to include visual references when contacting Guilherme about an original design
- A page where Guilherme can display his non-tattoo artwork and where users may purchase pieces and request custom artwork

### Testing user stories
- _I am a user who would like to see what kind of tattoos Guilguri Tattoo Studio specialises in. I expect to see a portfolio of completed tattoos and I would like to see what tattoos are currently available to choose from._ 
	+ If I am on desktop, on the home page, I can see the navigation menu at the top of the page. PORTFOLIO is clearly displayed here - exactly what I want. I click on it and I am taken to the portfolio page. The page is clearly divided into two sections, one for completed tattoos and one for available tattoos. The photos of the completed tattoos are clearly laid out and of good quality and all seem to have been taken in the same place and with the same type of camera, which gives a pleasant continuity and consistency. The images in the available designs sections are similarly laid out and of a high quality so I can clearly see the details of the designs. The text tells me that I can choose one of these labelled designs or I can speak to the artist about a custom design. There is a button that takes me directly to the contact page in a new tab, so I don't have to go back to the page to check the name of the design I wanted to enquire about. 
	+ If I'm on a tablet or phone, on the home page, I can see the menu icon at the top of the screen. If I click on this, there is a drop-down menu with PORTFOLIO clearly displayed. This takes me to the portfolio page. The images are still clearly visible on a tablet or mobile device. Even on my small iPhone screen, I can still see the details of the available tattoo designs.
	 
	__Test result: SUCCESS__
	
- _I am a user who likes the portfolio I've seen on the Guilguri website but I got my last tattoo in a studio that was busy and noisy and uncomfortable and it wasn't a pleasant experience. So now, I want to see what the Guilguri studio looks like and what kind of environment it is before I get in touch about a tattoo._
	+ The navigation bar on the home page has a link ABOUT. I expect this to tell me about the artist and hopefully the studio also. This page is divided into two sections. The second section has a short description about the studio and some clear photos. Judging by the photos, the studio looks clean, orderly, and relaxing. The room has plants and a couch and I can see trees outside. Already, it looks welcoming and comfortable. The description says that the studio is private and by appointment only and promises my tattooing session can be a relaxed and personal experience.
	
	__Test result: SUCCESS__
	
- _I am a user who is looking for a tattoo artist and studio with a relaxed, open-minded vibe and outlook. I would like to get a sense of the artist and who they are before I consider getting a tattoo from them._
	+ The navigation bar on the home page has a link ABOUT. I expect this to tell me about the artist. The first section of the page has a photo of the artist and a small bio. The artist looks relaxed and friendly and approachable in the photo. The bio tells me about his background and some silly, irrelevant facts about him. This gives me a good impression of him. The use of he/him to specify his pronouns tells me he's aware of gender identify issues and is open-minded and accepting of it. The text in the following section about the studio describes it as an LGBTQIA+ inclusive studio. This tells me the artist is welcoming and open-minded about social issues and I am likely to be respected here.
	 
	__Test result: SUCCESS__
	
- _I am a user who has found the Guilguri tattoo studio's website in my phone's browser. I like the look of the studio and the artist's portfolio and while I don't want to contact him about a tattoo right now, I would like some way to keep track of him and his work but I don't want to have to keep returning to this website. I'd like if the website had some social links to enable me to keep tabs on it on other platforms._
	+ At the bottom of each page on the website, there are social icons for both Facebook and Instagram. The Instagram link takes me to the Guilguri Instagram account where I can follow him.
	 
	__Test result: SUCCESS__
	
- _I am a user who has browsed all of the Guilguri website and I've decided I want to contact the artist about a custom tattoo. Ideally, I would like a form I can fill out with my details instead of having to copy and paste an email address and then composing an email in my own email account because I am browsing using my phone._
	+ In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, there is a link called CONTACT which takes me directly to the contact page. On this page, there is some text which tells me to describe what kind of custom tattoo I am looking for. There is a form to fill in with my name, email address and my message. The form is easy to read and fill out, even on my phone.
	
	__Test result: SUCCESS__
